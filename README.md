# Ria's Graphs-- Project02
 This repo contains the two graphs from  `.json` and the `.csv` datasets.
 Here is a [link](https://github.com/mikeizbicki/cmc-csci040/tree/2022fall/project_02) to the class project page. 
  
 
 ## Graphs 
 * Plot 1 `.json` (Title in graph- **Temperature vs. Year**)

 This graph plots the average global temperature from 1880-2015 versus the average global temperature from 1901-2000. The data,[Global Temperature Anamoly](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cag/time-series/global/globe/land_ocean/ytd/12/1880-2016.json), comes from the National Centers for Environmental Information. The linegraph is interesting to see the increase in average global temperatures over time. 
 
  * Plot 2 `.csv`(Title in graph- **Olympic Height of Males and Females by Year**)
 
 <img width="781" alt="Screen Shot 2022-10-24 at 4 13 02 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/112538914/197669626-9b8cb01a-6c46-432a-a634-6d9037f1b66c.png">

This second plot shows the height of male and female Olympic athletes over the course of multiple years. The dataset comes from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/heesoo37/120-years-of-olympic-history-athletes-and-results), which includes 120 years of Olympic history. The scatterplot makes it easy to see any outliers in height for both men and women.
